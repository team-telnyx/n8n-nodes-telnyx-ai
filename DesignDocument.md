### Thoughts

- The node is a REST API node, but it all starts with the `Resource` property.

First and foremost is Voice and then Chat

2. Generating text to speech: [Generate text to speech](https://api.telnyx.com/v2/text-to-speech/speech)
3. Getting speech to text: [Generate speech to text](https://api.telnyx.com/v2/ai/audio/transcriptions)

For the Chat `Resource` we have the following `Operations`:

1. Getting the models available: [Get All Models](https://api.telnyx.com/v2/ai/models)
