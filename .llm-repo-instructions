[ai_agent_software_engineer]
When opening a PR, add the name of the Jira ticket assignee (who is the AI agent invoker) in the PR title along with the Jira ticket ID.
Follow this pattern: [ASSIGNEE_NAME] [JIRA_TICKET] Title.
Always open PRs as drafts.
Install dependencies with `npm install`
Do not try to import any packages that are not defined in the closest package.json file from the file you are working on.
Handle errors gracefully - don't assume happy paths.
Comment only when code isn't self-explanatory.
No hardcoded values - use config or constants.
Commit messages should explain why, not what.
Keep functions short and focused on one task.
Use meaningful variable and function names.
Write code that is easy to understand over being clever.
Try to follow the .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file instructions when opening a PR.
For File name convention use PascalCase following the existing components in the project, for example: exampleNode.node.ts should be ExampleNode.node.ts
Always use naming exports for components.
Always use absolute imports using the config set in tsconfig.json as base.
Always double-check you implemented everything you have been asked.
Make sure that running `npm run lint` succeeds. If not then try to fix the linting errors using `npm run lintfix` but only try solving the task three times after a failure to make sure you don't go into a infinite loop
Run `npm run format` before committing to ensure the code style is consistent.

[ai_agent_code_reviewer]
Purpose: You review code changes and suggest improvements.
Focus on readability and simplicity first.
Check if code does what the PR title and description claim.
Look for edge cases and error handling.
Flag any security risks like unescaped inputs.
Check naming - variables and functions should be clear and consistent.
Look for duplicated code that could be refactored.
Flag complex code that could be simplified.
Verify basic code style (indentation, line length, spacing).
Comment with specific locations and suggestions for fixes.
Use github suggestion for improvements.
